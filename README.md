## üìñ About The Project

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, live at **[your-username].pythonanywhere.com**.

Unlike a simple static site, this project is a complete full-stack web application. It uses a Django backend to manage project data via a PostgreSQL database and a dynamic templating system to render the content. The frontend is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring modern, interactive animations to create an engaging user experience.

The primary goal was to build a robust and scalable platform for me to showcase my work, while also demonstrating my skills in backend architecture and full-stack development.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Dynamic Project Management:** All project data (titles, descriptions, images, links) is stored in a database and managed through the built-in Django Admin panel. This allows me to add, update, or remove projects without touching the source code.
*   **Interactive UI:** The frontend is packed with animations and interactive elements, including:
    *   A live `particles.js` background on the hero section.
    *   A "typing" effect for the main headline using `Typed.js`.
    *   Graceful "fade-up" animations on all elements using `AOS.js`.
*   **Live Previews:** Features an embedded `<iframe>` to showcase a live, interactive version of my "Chaotic Password Generator" directly on the homepage. Other projects can be previewed in a pop-up modal window.
*   **Markdown Case Studies:** In-depth project detail pages are rendered from Markdown, allowing for rich formatting and easy content creation.
*   **Responsive Design:** The entire site is fully responsive and designed to work beautifully on devices of all sizes, from mobile phones to desktop monitors.
